# VBiosFinder (linux)

This tool attempts to extract a VBIOS from a bios update  
Laptops with NVIDIA Optimus graphics often have the dGPU VBIOS integrated in their system BIOS, this makes extracting the VBIOS a complicated process. Provided you have a BIOS Update for your laptop, this tool might be able to automagically extract all available VBIOS from it.
